ok. so. there's a lot of good music out there and I don't really know too much about your tastes, so it's kind of hard to just recommend a bunch of bands. But I will try anyway.
Here's a list of somewhat accessible albums that I enjoy a lot. Let me know which ones you like and which ones you don't. Also, sometimes albums sound weird on first listen but they end up growing on you. So don't be too quick to turn a song off if it doesn't resonate with you right away. You don't have to listen to these in any particular order:
Album Name - Artist: Description
I'm Wide Awake It's Morning - Bright Eyes: a great folk/acoustic album with really good lyrics. can be kind of depressing. 
Full Album Stream:

In the Aeroplane Over the Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel: You may have heard this album as "the most hipster album ever" but don't let that affect your opinion of it. It's also a folk album with a lot of depth to it, lyrically and musically.

The Bends - Radiohead: Definitely the most accessible Radiohead album, this album is an awesome collection of hard-hitting brit rock songs from the 90s

OK Computer - Radiohead: One of my favorite albums of all time. It's hard to classify, but I would call it alternative rock. This album has a lot of musical diversity. You really just have to listen to it.

A Rush of Blood to the Head - Coldplay: probably my favorite Coldplay album, although they are all pretty great. You've definitely heard a bunch of these tracks before (Clocks was a pretty popular one). Coldplay is kind of like Radiohead without that weird edge. That makes them a lot more accessible but not as interesting to me personally. Still, this album is great rock music that should please your ears. If you like it, check out Viva la Vida (the album) and Mylo Xyloto

Hot Fuss - The Killers: Pretty popular rock band from Las Vegas. The frontman Brandon Flowers provides energetic and emotive vocals over crashing drums, distorted guitars, and synths. Check it out.

Helplessness Blues - Fleet Foxes: One of my favorite folk albums of all time. The instrumentation and vocal harmonies make give the songs a very sweet, pretty sound. Very enjoyable music with lyrical depth
All I could find was this playlist of songs (It's missing the last track, Grown Ocean, so you'll have to find that one separately):

Foxy Shazam (Self-titled): This rock album is electrifying and energetic from start to finish. Truly a wild, fun ride complete with crazy vocals, horns, and a girls choir on certain songs.

So I've given you mainly rock and folk music so far. Here's some different stuff:
The College Dropout - Kanye West: Kanye's first album. I love kanye mainly for his production (the beats/music behind his rapping) but his rapping is fine too. I don't know how you feel about hip hop, but this is a fun collection of songs with awesome old-school beats. The skits (the talking parts between songs) can get somewhat annoying though, so feel free to skip them.

Ready to Die - Notorious BIG: Quintessential old-school east coast hip hop. Great funk-inspire beats and Biggie's legendary flow. Yes I am white. The intro is kinda weird btw, you can skip it.

Giant Steps - John Coltrane: One of the saxophone greats. Hear him wail on one of the best jazz albums of all time. If you need more jazz recommendations, try out Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis

Funeral - Arcade Fire: Was my favorite album for a bit. Arcade Fire is a Canadian indie band of epic proportions. The group is comprised of around ten members, with strings, pianos, big bass drums, and more. This album reeks of emotion and loss, while holding onto an incredible energy. Check it out

So there ya go. These 12 albums should keep you busy for a while. The order you listen to them in doesn't really matter. And it's okay if you hate some of them. Let me know what you think
