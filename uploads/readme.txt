Hello Doctors Gardner and Gillet and the rest of council, 

I've figured out how to play music files natively in a way that hould work on most web browsers. I've posted the source code and my test sound effect. 
This was written in such a way that it would only work on MY own desktop howeverI'll demo it at the coming council meeitng. 

If you open the HTML file it says "/home/david/Desktop" referring to MY own filesystem on my laptop. 

Anyway I've learned how it works and just need whatever mp3 files you want to play on the website. So i'm going to consider this task done unless there's anything else that you want to go into this.
